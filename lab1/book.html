            <p class="wstep">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was inspired when, on 4 July 1862, Lewis Carroll and
                Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed up The Isis in a boat with three young girls.[6][7] The three girls
                were the daughters of scholar Henry Liddell: Lorina Charlotte Liddell (aged 13; "Prima" in the book's
                prefatory verse); Alice Pleasance Liddell (aged 10; "Secunda" in the verse); and Edith Mary Liddell
                (aged 8; "Tertia" in the verse).</p>
            <p>The journey began at Folly Bridge, Oxford, and ended 5 miles (8.0 km) away in Godstow, Oxfordshire.
                During the trip Carroll told the girls a story that he described in his diary as "Alice's Adventures
                Under Ground" and which his journal says he "undertook to write out for Alice".[9] Alice Liddell
                recalled that she asked Carroll to write it down: unlike other stories he had told her, this one she
                wanted to preserve.[10] She finally got the manuscript more than two years later.[11]</p>
            <p>4 July was known as the "golden afternoon", prefaced in the novel as a poem.[12] In fact, the weather
                around Oxford on 4 July was "cool and rather wet," although at least one scholar has disputed this
                claim.[13] Scholars debate whether Carroll in fact came up with Alice during the "golden afternoon" or
                whether the story was developed over a longer period.[12]</p>
            <p>Carroll had known the Liddell children since around March 1856, when he befriended Harry Liddell.[14] He
                met Lorina by early March as well.[15] In June 1856, he took the children out on the river.[16] Robert
                Douglas-Fairhurst, who wrote a literary biography of Carroll, suggests that Carroll favoured Alice
                Pleasance Liddell in particular because her name was ripe for allusion.[17] "Pleasance" means pleasure
                and the name "Alice" appeared in contemporary works including the poem "Alice Gray" by William Mee, of
                which Carroll wrote a parody; and Alice is a character in "Dream-Children: A Reverie", a prose piece by
                Charles Lamb.[17] Carroll, an amateur photographer by the late 1850s,[18] produced many photographic
                portraits of the Liddell children—but none more than Alice, of whom 20 survive.[1</p>
